# Framework

I used Django which is a python based framework

# Database

I used google firebase for storing data and used pyrebase(a simple python wrapper for firebase API)

# Installation of Pyrebase
pip install pyrebase

more details about pyrebase can be found here - https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase

# Note
It use firebase for storing data so, during adding new account it may reject to register because of name or password is short

I didn,t try bonus tasks because I wanted to do all 4 assignments
